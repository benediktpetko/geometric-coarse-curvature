# geometric-coarse-curvature
A testbed for numerical schemes for computing coarse curvature of geometric graphs.

The package affords computation with two types of curvature:
- a type of extrinsic curvature estimation from ambient distances
- Ricci curvature estimation from distances in geometric graphs
